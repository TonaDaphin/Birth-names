         <p>Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. 
           Are you one of those? If you are then ...ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Sorry, I had to let that off. Well this website will calculate your day of birth from the input birthdate.
          It's not just that. It will then proceed to tell your Akan name depending on the day you were born and gender. Cool huh? Go ahead and try it!</p>
